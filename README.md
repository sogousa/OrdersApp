This project covers the followings.

User signup and signin page (connected to db). Setup online cloud MogoDb server and configure connection locally in order to have requests go through. You should be able to create user providing the name, password, email address.
Use node.js and express to create UI.
Allow user to add Orders payload on text area. ( not connected to DB. run out of time to create schema, so requested ended locally and use map to store data);
Allow user to select one customer and display the associated orders. Since payload contains a lot of information, I designed an expanded table UX to show the order line detail in expanded panel. User should be able to click "+" on the left side of each row to show the Order Lines details. However, I run out of time to finish implementation because there are bugs on my codes. I commented out those codes on ejs.
npm install the extra packages, which can be found on the package.json file.
Please use the following comment to run this app.

npm run dev
